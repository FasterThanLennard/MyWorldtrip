Vaccination requirements and recommendations for international
travellers, including yellow fever and malaria
Introduction
The information provided for each country includes the country’s stated requirements and recommendations for
travellers regarding yellow fever vaccination2
 and malaria prevention; a brief description on the malaria risk situation
is provided where appropriate. The country’s stated requirements for other diseases are also mentioned, if any3
.
Country requirements are subject to change at any time. It is important that travellers ensure they know the
requirements of the country to which they are travelling by checking with the relevant consulate or embassy. The
latest updates received by WHO from countries can be found at: http://www.who.int/ith
Yellow fever
Vaccination
Yellow fever vaccination is carried out for two different purposes:
1. To prevent the international spread of the disease
 Countries protect themselves from the risk of importing or further spreading the yellow fever virus by establishing
entry requirements on yellow fever vaccination for travellers. The countries that require proof of vaccination are
those where the disease may or may not occur and where the mosquito vector and potential non-human primate
hosts of yellow fever are present. Any importation of the virus into such countries by infected travellers could result
in its propagation and establishment, leading to a permanent risk of infection for the human population. Proof of
vaccination is often required for travellers arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission and
sometimes for travellers in transit through such countries.
A meeting of yellow fever experts proposed, in 2010, that under 12 hours of airport transit in an area at risk of
yellow fever poses an almost non-existent risk of yellow fever and therefore that a proof of vaccination might not
be necessary. This information is provided to WHO Member States, but travellers are recommended to consult
individual country requirements by contacting the embassy of each country they intend to visit. It should be noted
that some countries require proof of vaccination from all travellers.
Countries requiring yellow fever vaccination for entry do so in accordance with the International Health
Regulations. Yellow fever is currently the only disease for which proof of vaccination may be required for travellers
as a condition of entry to a State Party under Annex 7 of the International Health Regulations (IHR). An important
change in May 2014 was the adoption by the World Health Assembly of an updated Annex 7, extending the validity
of a certificate of vaccination against yellow fever from 10 years to life; this will come into force from 11th July
2016.
The fact that a country has no requirement for yellow fever vaccination does not imply that there is no risk
of yellow fever transmission.

1 In this publication, the terms “country” and “countries” cover countries, territories and areas.
2 WHO publishes these requirements for informational purposes only; this publication does not constitute an
endorsement or confirmation that such requirements are in accordance with the provisions of the International Health
Regulations.
3 The requirements for vaccination of infants over 6 months of age by some countries are not in accordance with
WHO’s advice (Chapter 6). Travellers should, however, be informed that the requirement exists for entry into the
countries concerned. When available, the date of the most recent update or confirmation is indicated in parentheses in
the country list. If no date is indicated, the most recent update or confirmation was provided before 2013.
2. To protect individual travellers who may be exposed to yellow fever infection
The risk of yellow fever transmission depends on the presence of the virus in the country in humans, mosquitoes or
animals. As yellow fever is frequently fatal for those who have not been vaccinated, vaccination is recommended
for all travellers (with few exceptions, Chapter 6) visiting areas where there is a risk of yellow fever transmission.
Annex 1 in the International Travel and Health publication provides a summary list of countries with risk of yellow
fever transmission in whole or in part as defined by WHO as well as a list of countries that require proof of yellow
fever vaccination as a condition for entry.
WHO determines those areas where “a risk of yellow fever transmission is present” on the basis of the diagnosis of
cases of yellow fever in humans and/or animals, the results of yellow fever sero-surveys and the presence of vectors
and animal reservoirs. The scientific and technical advisory group on geographical yellow fever risk mapping
(GRYF) was established in 2015 to maintain up-to-date yellow fever risk mapping and to provide guidance on
yellow fever vaccination for travellers in ways that facilitate international travel, see further information from
http://www.who.int/ith/yellow-fever-risk-mapping/en/
Decisions regarding the use of yellow fever vaccine for travellers must weigh several factors, including the risk of
travel-associated yellow fever virus disease, country requirements, and the potential for serious adverse events
following yellow fever vaccination (Chapter 6).
The table below summarizes WHO’s revised recommendations for yellow fever vaccination for travellers.
Yellow fever vaccination category Rationale for recommendation
Recommended Yellow fever vaccination is recommended for all travellers ≥ 9 months old in areas where there
is evidence of persistent or periodic yellow fever virus transmission.
Generally not recommended Yellow fever vaccination is generally not recommended in areas where there is low potential
for yellow fever virus exposure (no human yellow fever cases ever reported and evidence to
suggest only low levels of yellow fever virus transmission in the past). However, vaccination
might be considered for a small subset of travellers to these areas who are at increased risk of
exposure to mosquitoes or unable to avoid mosquito bites. When considering vaccination, any
traveller must take into account the risk of being infected with yellow fever virus, country
entry requirements, as well as individual risk factors (e.g. age, immune status) for serious
vaccine-associated adverse events.
Polio
On 5 May 2014 the Director-General declared the international spread of wild poliovirus in 2014 to be a public
health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations, and issued
temporary recommendations to reduce the international spread of wild poliovirus. Recommendations concerning
international travellers coming from affected countries are below.
For States currently exporting wild poliovirus (WPV) or circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), it is
recommended that:
• All residents and long-term visitors (i.e. > 4 weeks) of all ages receive a dose of oral poliovirus vaccine
(OPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.
• International travellers undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within 4 weeks) who have not received a dose of OPV
or IPV in the previous 4 weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure;
this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers.
• Travellers are provided with an international certificate of vaccination or prophylaxis in the form specified in
Annex 6 of the IHR, to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.
• The international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination is restricted at
the point of departure. This applies to international travellers from all points of departure, irrespective of
means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea).
For States affected by WPV or cVDPV but not currently exporting, it is recommended that:
• Residents and long-term visitors receive a dose of OPV or IPV 4 weeks to 12 months prior to international
travel, or, for those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within 4 weeks), a dose at least by the time of departure.
• Travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio
vaccination status.
Updates on currently endemic and affected States, whether exporting the disease or not, can be found at:
http://www.polioeradication.org (“key countries” page).
Some individual polio-free countries also require proof of polio vaccination for a visa or entry into their territory. It is
important that travellers ensure they know the requirements of the country to which they are travelling by checking
with the relevant consulate.
Malaria
General information about malaria, its geographical distribution and details of preventive measures are included in
Chapter 7. Protective measures against mosquito bites are described in Chapter 3. Specific information for each
country is provided in this section, including epidemiological details for all countries with malarious areas
(geographical and seasonal distribution, altitude, predominant species, reported resistance). The recommended
prevention is also indicated. For each country, recommended prevention is decided on the basis of the following
factors: the risk of contracting malaria; the prevailing species of malaria parasites in the area; the level and spread of
drug resistance reported from the country; and the possible risk of serious side-effects resulting from the use of the
various prophylactic drugs. Where Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax both occur, prevention of falciparum malaria
takes priority. Unless the malaria risk is defined as due “exclusively” to a certain species (P. falciparum or P. vivax),
travellers may be at risk of any of the parasite species, including mixed infections. P. falciparum resistance to
chloroquine and sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine is at present nearly universal and is no longer specifically mentioned in
the country list below; these two medications currently have no role in the prevention or treatment of falciparum
malaria in travellers.
The letters A, B, C and D refer to the type of prevention based on the table below.
 Malaria risk Type of prevention
Type A Very limited risk of malaria Mosquito bite prevention only
 transmission
Type B Risk of P. vivax malaria only Mosquito bite prevention plus
 chloroquine chemoprophylaxisa

Type C Risk of P. falciparum Mosquito bite prevention plus
 malaria, in combination with atovaquone–proguanil or doxycycline
 reported chloroquine and or mefloquine chemoprophylaxis
 sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance (select according to reported side-effects and contraindications)a
Type D Risk of P. falciparum Mosquito bite prevention plus
 malaria in combination atovaquone–proguanil or doxycycline
 with reported multidrug or mefloquine chemoprophylaxis (select
 resistance according to reported drug resistance pattern,
 side-effects and contraindications) a,b
a
 Alternatively, for travel to rural areas with low risk of malaria infection, mosquito bite prevention can be combined with stand-by emergency
treatment (SBET).
b In certain areas with multidrug-resistant malaria, mefloquine chemoprophylaxis is no longer recommended. At present these areas include
Cambodia, south-eastern Myanmar and Thailand.

Information on the main infectious disease threats for travellers, their geographical distribution, and corresponding
precautions are provided in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 provides information on vaccine-preventable diseases.
